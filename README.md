## Purpose is to understand the right format for markdown and also create my first repository

# I am also trying to create a list right here 
* this is how you do it 
 
 you can also create a list with numbers, and this is how you do it

 1. item 1
 2. item two 
    * sublist
 3. item 3
 4. *I can also do italics*
 5. **bolded phrase**
 6. ~~both combined~~

To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.           

Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.
(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)
